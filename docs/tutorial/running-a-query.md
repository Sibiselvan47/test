We are going to use what [we developed in the previous steps](/docs/tutorial/write-your-resolvers).

In order to query the **Recipes Manager GraphQL API**, `tartiflette-aiohttp` embed the GraphiQL client, available at this address [http://localhost:8080/graphiql](http://localhost:8080/graphiql) when your server is live.

## Get all the recipes

Copy/paste this GraphQL Query to your GraphiQL instance and execute it.

```graphql
{
  recipes {
    id
    name
    cookingTime
  }
}
```

## Get all the recipes with ingredients

The power of GraphQL is to be able to get many different resources in a single request.

We will execute a request to retrieve the recipes with all the ingredients.

```graphql
query {
  recipes {
    id
    name
    cookingTime
    ingredientsQuantity {
      name
      quantity
      type
    }
  }
}
```

## Get only one recipe

Below, a request to select only on recipe, by its `id`.

```graphql
{
  recipe(id: 1) {
    id
    name
    cookingTime
    ingredientsQuantity {
      name
      quantity
      type
    }
  }
}
```
